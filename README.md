# rye-init

Demo repository to use [`rye`](https://rye.astral.sh/).

## pre-requisites

- rust ([ref](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
- rye ([ref](https://rye.astral.sh/guide/installation/))

**Note**: Select [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as the package
installer. For more customisations, refer to
[docs](https://rye.astral.sh/guide/installation/#customized-installation).

## setup

1. initialise project:

   ```shell
   rye init && rye pin 3.12
   ```

1. add, lock and install dependencies:

   ```shell
   rye add fastapi pillow pydantic && rye sync
   ```

1. code check (optional):

   ```shell
   rye fmt && rye lint --fix
   ```

## usage

1. run development server:

   ```shell
   rye run dev
   ```

1. run app with docker:

   ```shell
   # start app
   rye run docker-up -d --build

   # stop app
   rye run docker-down
   ```

## notes

- `uv` is an incredible package resolver ðŸ¤¯! below is a terminal screenshot of
  how fast it resolves and locks dependencies for the above `rye add` command:

- `rye scripts` are similar to npm scripts and can used to setup automation or
  simplify development processes.

- setting up local dependencies is still a work in progress
  ([ref](https://github.com/astral-sh/rye/issues/1179)). `rye` supports local
  dependencies but the lock files use the absolute paths instead of relative.
  This can be a nuisance when working on a complex project with multiple
  developers.

- compared to poetry, rye provided a simpler experience to setup this demo
  project. Although both are very similar in terms of features, rye also offers
  python version management. read this amazing blog for more in-depth comparison
